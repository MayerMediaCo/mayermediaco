# My Personal Website

This site is built using Gatsby V2 with some help from Bulma for a css framework.  There is still a ton of work I plan on doing to the site including:
- Blog Pagination
- SEO work
- Adding social sharing features to the blog
- Work on overall site accessibility
- Switching to styled components and moving away from Bulma framework
- Animating page transitions
- Animating buttons, icons, and other bits and pieces on the site

Amoung these upcoming features, I plan on making it a bit of a playground for experimentation and trying new things out on
